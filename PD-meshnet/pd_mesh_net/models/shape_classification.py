class DualPrimalMeshClassifier(BaseDualPrimalModel):
    r"""Architecture for learning a global shape descriptor (classification).
    Based on analogous network from MeshCNN
    (https://github.com/ranahanocka/MeshCNN/).


    Args:
        in_channels_primal, in_channels_dual (int): Size of each input sample
            from the primal/dual graph respectively.
        norm_layer_type (str or None): Type of normalization layer to be used
            after each convolutional layer, both primal and dual. Possible
            options are: `None` (no normalization layer), `'group_norm'` (group
            normalization), `'batch_norm'` (batch normalization).
        num_groups_norm_layer (int): If `norm_layer_type` is 'group_norm',
            number of groups in each normalization layer.
        conv_primal_out_res, conv_dual_out_res (list of int): Number of output
            channels of each primal/dual convolutional layer respectively, i.e.,
            dimension of the feature vectors outputted by the primal/dual
            convolutional layers respectively.
        num_classes (int): Number of classes in the dataset.
        num_output_units_fc (int): Number of output unit of the first
            fully-connected layer (`fc1`).
        single_dual_nodes (bool): If True, it will be assumed that the dual
            graphs have single nodes; otherwise, it will be assumed that they
            have double nodes. Cf. :obj:`pd_mesh_net.utils.GraphCreator`.
        undirected_dual_edges (bool): If True, it will be assumed that every
            directed edge in the dual graphs has an opposite directed edge;
            otherwise, it will be assumed that directed edges in the dual graphs
            do not have an opposite directed edge.
            Cf. :obj:`pd_mesh_net.utils.GraphCreator`.
        num_primal_edges_to_keep (list of int/None, optional):
            Either None or a list of int values.
            - If not None, the value of the i-th element represents the target
              number of primal edges to keep in the pooling layer after the i-th
              convolutional layer.
            At most one of this and the arguments
            `fractions_primal_edges_to_keep` and
            `primal_attention_coeffs_thresholds` can be not None. If they all
            are None, no pooling layers are inserted in the network.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        fractions_primal_edges_to_keep (list of float/None, optional):
            Either None or a list of float values.
            - If not None, the value of the i-th element represents the target
              fraction of primal edges to keep in the pooling layer after the
              i-th convolutional layer.
            At most one of this and the arguments `num_primal_edges_to_keep` and
            `primal_attention_coeffs_thresholds` can be not None. If they all
            are None, no pooling layers are inserted in the network.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        primal_attention_coeffs_thresholds (list of float/None, optional):
            Either None or a list of float values.
            - If not None, the value of the i-th element represents the
              threshold used in the pooling layer after the i-th convolutional
              layer to pool primal edges for which the attention coefficient is
              above/below this value, depending on the argument
              `use_decreasing_attention_coefficients`.
            At most one of this and the arguments `num_primal_edges_to_keep` and
            `fractions_primal_edges_to_keep` can be not None. If they all are
            None, no pooling layers are inserted in the network.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        num_res_blocks (int, optional): Number of residual blocks.
            (default: :obj:`3`).
        heads (int, optional): Number of attention heads associated to each of
            the primal and dual convolutional layers. (default: :obj:`1`)
        concat_primal, concat_dual (bool, optional): If set to :obj:`False`, the
            attention heads associated respectively to the primal and to the
            dual convolutional layers are averaged instead of concatenated.
            (default: :obj:`True`)
        negative_slope_primal, negative_slope_dual (float, optional): LeakyReLU
            angle of the negative slope, respectively for the layers associated
            to the primal graph and for the layers associated to the dual graph.
            (default: :obj:`0.2`)
        dropout_primal, dropout_dual (float, optional): Dropout probability of
            the normalized attention coefficients which exposes each node,
            respectively of the primal and of the dual convolutional layers, to
            a stochastically sampled neighborhood during training.
            (default: :obj:`0`)
        bias_primal, bias_dual (bool, optional): If set to :obj:`False`, the
            layers associated respectively to the primal and to the dual graph
            will not learn an additive bias. (default: :obj:`False`)
        add_self_loops_to_dual_graph (bool, optional): If set to :obj:`True`,
            regular graph-attention convolutional layers are instantiated as
            dual convolutional layers, thus self-loops are added to the dual
            graph. Furthermore, self-loops are added to dual graphs generated by
            pooling layers. If set to :obj:`False` instead, a modified version
            of the graph-attention convolutional layer is instantiated for the
            dual convolutional layers, with no addition of self-loops to the
            latter, and no self loops are added to the dual graphs generated by
            pooling layers. (default: :obj:`False`)
        allow_pooling_consecutive_edges (bool, optional): If True, no
            restrictions are put on the primal edges that can be pooled by the
            pooling layers in the model. If False, a primal edge can only be
            pooled if no primal nodes to which it belongs have been pooled
            previously. Setting this argument to False is only compatible with
            top-K pooling (cf. arguments `num_primal_edges_to_keep` and
            `fractions_primal_edges_to_keep`). (default: :obj:`True`)
        aggr_primal_features_pooling (str, optional): Parameter of the optional
            pooling layer. If 'mean'/'add', the feature of each new primal node
            after pooling is obtained by respectively averaging and summing the
            features of the primal nodes that get merged into that node.
            (default: :obj:`mean`)
        aggr_dual_features_pooling (str, optional): Parameter of the optional
            pooling layer. If 'mean'/'add', whenever a new dual node is obtained
            by aggregating multiple previous dual nodes its feature is obtained
            by respectively averaging and summing the features of the previous
            dual nodes. (default: :obj:`mean`)
        use_decreasing_attention_coefficients (bool, optional): When using
            pooling based on an amount of edges (cf. arguments 
            `num_primal_edges_to_keep` and `fractions_primals_edges_to_keep`):
            if True, primal edges are pooled by decreasing magnitude of the
            associated attention coefficients; if False, primal edges are pooled
            by increasing magnitude of the associated attention coefficients.
            When using pooling based on attention-coefficient threshold (cf.
            argument `primal_attention_coeffs_thresholds`): primal edges are
            pooled if the associated attention coefficients are above the
            threshold - if True - or below the threshold - if False.
            (default: :obj:`True`)
        return_node_to_cluster (bool, optional): If True, each call to the
            forward method will also return a dict of `num_pooling_layers`
            lists, where `num_pooling_layers` is the number of pooling layers
            in the network. The i-th element of the list with key j will contain
            the index of the face cluster to which the i-th face in the mesh
            inputted to the j-th pooling layer belongs after the j-th pooling
            operation. If no pooling layer is present in the network, None is
            returned. (default: :obj:`False`)
        log_ratios_new_old_primal_nodes (bool, optional): If True, each call to
            the forward method will also return a namedtuple. Its element with
            key `ratios_new_old_primal_nodes` is a dict of `num_pooling_layers`
            tensors, where `num_pooling_layers` is the number of pooling layers
            in the network. Each of the `num_pooling_layers` tensors will be of
            length `num_samples` elements - where `num_samples` is the number of
            samples in the batch. The i-th element of the tensor with key j will
            contain the ratio between the number of primal nodes in the new,
            pooled graph and the number of primal nodes before pooling, for the
            i-th sample in the batch and with pooling applied by the pooling
            layer that follows the j-th convolutional layer in the network.
            (default: :obj:`True`)
        log_ratios_new_old_primal_edges (bool, optional): If True, each call to
            the forward method will also return a namedtuple. Its element with
            key `ratios_new_old_primal_edges` is a dict of `num_pooling_layers`
            tensors, where `num_pooling_layers` is the number of pooling layers
            in the network. Each of the `num_pooling_layers` tensors will be of
            length `num_samples` elements - where `num_samples` is the number of
            samples in the batch. The i-th element of the tensor with key j will
            contain the ratio between the number of primal edges in the new,
            pooled graph and the number of primal edges before pooling, for the
            i-th sample in the batch and with pooling applied by the pooling
            layer that follows the j-th convolutional layer in the network.
            (default: :obj:`False`)

    Attributes:
        fc1, fc2 (torch.nn.Linear): Fully-connected layers.
        _indices_pooling_layers (list): If the element `i` is in this list, then
            the i-th convolutional layer in the network is followed by a pooling
            layer.

                dictionary.
