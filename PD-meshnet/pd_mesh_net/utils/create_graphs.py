class GraphCreator:
    r"""Creates the primal- ("simplex mesh", or what is commonly known as the
    "dual graph" of the triangulation seen as a planar graph) and dual- ("medial
    graph" of the triangulation) graph from a given input mesh.

    Args:
        mesh (pymesh.Mesh.Mesh, optional): If not None, input mesh. Note: if
            this option is used, it will be assumed that the mesh has already
            been preprocessed (i.e., with removal of duplicated vertices,
            duplicated faces, zero-area faces and optionally non-manifold
            edges). If you wish to perform preprocessing, use function
            `preprocess_mesh` from `pd_mesh_net.utils`. (default: :obj:`None`)
        mesh_filename (str, optional): If not None, filename of the input mesh.
            Note: if this option is used, it will be assumed that the mesh has
            not been preprocessed yet, so preprocessing will be applied (i.e.,
            with removal of duplicated vertices, duplicated faces, zero-area
            faces and optionally non-manifold edges, cf. argument
            `prevent_nonmanifold_edges`). (default: :obj:`None`)
        single_dual_nodes (bool, optional): If True, for each undirected primal
            edge `{i, j}` (i.e., for each pair of opposite directed primal edges
            `i->j` and `j->i`) a single dual node `{i, j}` is created. If False,
            for each primal edge `{i, j}`, a pair of dual nodes `i->j` and
            `j->i` are created, corresponding to the primal edges `i->j` and
            `j->i` respectively. (default: :obj:`True`)
        undirected_dual_edges (bool, optional): If True, dual edges are created
            as pairs of opposite directed edges (i.e., they can be seen an
            undirected edge); otherwise, dual edges are created as directed,
            i.e., each dual edge has no opposite edge. In particular:
            - If single dual nodes are created (cf. argument
              `single_dual_nodes`), this argument can only be True. Each dual
              node `{i, j}` is connected via undirected edges to the dual nodes
              of the form `{i, m}` and `{j, n}`, with `m` neighboring face of
              `i` different from `j` and `n` neighboring face of `j` different
              from `i`. That is to say, the following directed dual edges are
              created: `{i, m}->{i, j}`, `{i, j}->{i, m}`, `{j, n}->{i, j}`,
              `{i, j}->{j, n}`. We refer to this configuration of the dual graph
              as configuration A.
            - If double dual nodes are created (cf. argument
              `single_dual_nodes`) and this argument is True, each dual node
              `i->j` is connected via undirected edges to the dual nodes of the
              form `m->i` and `j->n`, with `m` neighboring face of `i` different
              from `j` and `n` neighboring face of `j` different from `i`. That
              is to say, the following directed dual edges are created:
              `(m->i)->(i->j)`, `(i->j)->(m->i), `(i->j)->(j->n)`,
              `(j->n)->(i->j)`. We refer to this configuration of the dual graph
              as configuration B.
            - If double dual nodes are created (cf. argument
              `single_dual_nodes`) and this argument is False, each dual node
              `i->j` is connected via an incoming directed edge to the dual
              nodes of the form `m->i` and via an outgoing directed edge to the
              dual nodes of the form `j->n`, with `m` neighboring face of `i`
              different from `j` and `n` neighboring face of `j` different from
              `i`. That is to say, the following directed dual edges are
              created: `(m->i)->(i->j)`, `(i->j)->(j->n)`. We refer to this
              configuration of the dual graph as configuration C.
            (default: :obj:`True`)
        prevent_nonmanifold_edges (bool, optional): If True, the faces of the
            input mesh are parsed one at a time and only considered if adding
            them to the set of previous faces does not cause any edges to become
            non-manifold. (default: :obj:`True`)
        primal_features_from_dual_features (bool, optional): Whether or not the
            features of the nodes in the primal graph should be computed from
            the features of the nodes in the dual graph. In particular, drawing
            inspiration from MeshCNN (https://github.com/ranahanocka/MeshCNN/):
            - If True:
                - In dual-graph configurations B and C (cf. argument
                  `undirected_dual_edges`), the dual-graph node `i->j` is
                  assigned as features:
                  1. The dihedral angle between faces `i` and `j` in the
                     original triangular mesh (referred to as
                     :math:`\alpha_{ij}`);
                  2. The ratio (referred to as :math:`k_{ij}`) between the
                     length of the edge between faces `i` and `j` (referred to
                     as :math:`e_{ij}`) and the corresponding height in face i
                     in the original triangular mesh;
                  3. The ratio (referred to as :math:`r_{ij}_{bef}`) between
                     :math:`e_{ij}` and the length of the one, among the two
                     remaining half-edges in face `i`, that has as end point the
                     starting point of the half-edge between faces `i` and `j`.
                     For instance, if face `i` in the original triangular mesh
                     has vertices :math:`v_1`, :math:`v_2` and :math:`v_3`,
                     half-edges :math:`v_1 \rightarrow v_2`,
                     :math:`v_2 \rightarrow v_3` and
                     :math:`v_3 \rightarrow v_1`, and if the half-edge between
                     face `i` and face `j` is :math:`v_2 \rightarrow v_3`, then
                     :math:`r_{ij}_{bef} = \frac{\|v_2 \rightarrow v_3\|}{
                         \|v_1 \rightarrow v_2\|}`, where :math:`\|\bullet\|`
                     denotes the length of an half-edge;
                  4. The ratio (referred to as :math:`r_{ij}_{aft}`) between
                     :math:`e_{ij}` and the length of the one, among the two
                     remaining half-edges in face `i`, that has as starting
                     point the end point of the half-edge between faces `i` and
                     `j`. For instance, if face `i` in the original triangular
                     mesh has vertices :math:`v_1`, :math:`v_2` and :math:`v_3`,
                     half-edges :math:`v_1 \rightarrow v_2`,
                     :math:`v_2 \rightarrow v_3` and
                     :math:`v_3 \rightarrow v_1`, and if the half-edge between
                     face `i` and face `j` is :math:`v_2 \rightarrow v_3`, then
                     :math:`r_{ij}_{aft} = \frac{\|v_2 \rightarrow v_3\|}{
                         \|v_3 \rightarrow v_1\|}`, where :math:`\|\bullet\|`
                     denotes the length of an half-edge;
                  The primal-graph node `i` is then assigned as features:
                  1. The average of the angles :math:`\alpha_{im}` over its
                     neighbors `m`;
                  2. The average of the ratios :math:`k_{im}` over its neighbors
                     `m`;
                  3. The average of the ratios :math:`r_{im}_{bef}` over its
                     neighbors `m`;
                  4. The average of the ratios :math:`r_{im}_{aft}` over its
                     neighbors `m`.
                - In dual-graph configuration A (cf. argument
                  `undirected_dual_edges`), the dual-graph node `{i, j}` is
                  assigned as features:
                  1. The dihedral angle between faces `i` and `j` in the
                     original triangular mesh (referred to as
                     :math:`\alpha_{ij}`);
                  2.,3. The two ratios - sorted in increasing order - between
                     the edge between faces `i` and `j` and the corresponding
                     height in face `i` and `j` respectively in the original
                     triangular mesh (referred to as :math:`k_{ij}` and as
                     :math:`k_{ji}`);
                  4.,5. The two ratios :math:`r_{ij}_{bef}` and
                     :math:`r_{ji}_{bef}` defined as above, sorted in the same
                     order as 2.,3., i.e., if :math:`k_{ij} < k_{ji}` then
                     4. = :math:`r_{ij}_{bef}` and 5. = :math:`r_{ji}_{bef}`,
                     otherwise 4. = :math:`r_{ji}_{bef}` and
                     5. = :math:`r_{ij}_{bef}`;
                  6.,7. The two ratios :math:`r_{ij}_{aft}` and
                     :math:`r_{ji}_{aft}` defined as above, sorted in the same
                     order as 2.,3., i.e., if :math:`k_{ij} < k_{ji}` then
                     4. = :math:`r_{ij}_{aft}` and 5. = :math:`r_{ji}_{aft}`,
                     otherwise 4. = :math:`r_{ji}_{aft}` and
                     5. = :math:`r_{ij}_{aft}`.
                  Primal-graph nodes are then assigned as features the same
                  features as in the case of dual-graph configurations B and C.
            - If False: the dual-graph nodes are assigned the same features as
                the case above. As for the primal-graph nodes, node `i` in the
                primal graph, corresponding to face `i` in the original
                triangular mesh, is assigned as features the ratio between the
                area of face `i` and the average of the areas of all the faces
                in the mesh.

        r"""Creates the edges in the dual graph (medial graph) that connect the
        dual node(s) associated to the primal edges in the input face to its
        (their) neighbors in the dual graph. As opposed to
        :obj:`__create_dual_edges_unordered`, for each dual node a strict order
        is followed. Letting A and B be two adjacent faces of the mesh (primal
        nodes), M, N, B be the adjacent faces of A in counter-clockwise order
        and J, K, A be the adjacent faces of B in counter-clockwise order, let
        us consider the cases of the three possible dual-graph configurations:
        - Dual-graph configuration A (single dual nodes, undirected dual edges):
          Dual edges incoming to the dual node {A, B} are added to edge list in
          the following order: {A, M}->{A, B}, {A, N}->{A, B}, {B, J}->{A, B},
          {B, K}->{A, B}.
        - Dual-graph configuration B (double dual nodes, undirected dual edges):
          Dual edges incoming to the dual node A->B are added to edge list in
          the following order: (M->A)->(A->B), (N->A)->(A->B), (B->J)->(A->B),
          (B->K)->(A->B). Dual edges incoming to the dual node B->A are added to
          edge list in the following order: (J->B)->(B->A), (K->B)->(B->A),
          (A->M)->(B->A), (A->N)->(B->A).
        - Dual-graph configuration C (double dual nodes, directed dual edges):
          Dual edges incoming to the dual node A->B are added to edge list in
          the following order: (M->A)->(A->B), (N->A)->(A->B). Dual edges
          incoming to the dual node B->A are added to edge list in the following
          order: (J->B)->(B->A), (K->B)->(B->A).
        Note: in all the cases, each dual node other than the 'special' one
        required to represent boundary edges of the mesh - has also a self-loop
        added at the end of the list of its incoming edges, but directly in the
        :obj:`create_graphs` method.

        Args:
            face_idx (int): The dual nodes associated to the edges in the face
                with this index will be connected to other nodes in the dual
                graph, via new dual edges.
